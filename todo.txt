this is the workflow of interaction with lucy but we have a problem 


Contract deployed successfully! Address: B9ikFyh9XoGLzeDr6tAz1hX68CkrRwJrRXLqSZvGi6z9 this address fetching takes too long why is that the response comes fast but displaying the address takes too long time 

at phase 4 after payment is complete it says 
Processing transaction... but for too long why is that 
 



this is how the conversation went 

I am Lucy, a specialized AI agent focused on creating smart contracts on the Solana network, with an emphasis on DAO-related contracts. How can I assist you further with your smart contract needs?


make me a DAO for voting


Phase 1: To create a DAO for voting on Solana, I need to understand more about your requirements. What specific voting mechanisms are you looking to implement? Are there any particular features or governance structures you want to include?


no just normal voting 


Phase 2: To proceed with creating a DAO for normal voting on Solana, I need more details. How should the voting process work? For example, do you want a simple majority to pass a vote, or should there be a specific threshold? Also, are there any additional features you'd like to include, such as proposal submission or time limits for voting?


simple majority to pass a vote and no threshold 


Phase 2: To proceed with creating a DAO for normal voting on Solana with a simple majority to pass a vote and no specific threshold, I need more details. Are there any additional features you'd like to include, such as proposal submission or time limits for voting?


no proposal submission and time limit is 1day


Phase 3: Here is the Solana Rust contract code for your DAO with normal voting, a simple majority to pass a vote, and a 1-day voting limit:

rust
use solana_program::{
    account_info::{next_account_info, AccountInfo},
    entrypoint::ProgramResult,
    program_error::ProgramError,
    pubkey::Pubkey,
};

solana_program::entrypoint!(process_instruction);

fn process_instruction(
    program_id: &Pubkey,
    accounts: &[AccountInfo],
    instruction_data: &[u8],
) -> ProgramResult {
    let accounts_iter = &mut accounts.iter();
    let dao_account = next_account_info(accounts_iter)?;
    let voter_account = next_account_info(accounts_iter)?;

    if !voter_account.is_signer {
        return Err(ProgramError::MissingRequiredSignature);
}

    if dao_account.owner != program_id {
        return Err(ProgramError::IncorrectProgramId);
    }

    let mut dao_data = dao_account.try_borrow_mut_data()?;
    let mut votes = 0;
    let mut total_voters = 0;

    // Deserialize votes and total voters
    votes = u64::from_le_bytes(dao_data[0..8].try_into().unwrap());
    total_voters = u64::from_le_bytes(dao_data[8..16].try_into().unwrap());

    // Increment vote if not already voted
    if !dao_data[16 + (voter_account.key.to_bytes()[0] as usize) / 8] & (1 << (voter_account.key.to_bytes()[0] as usize % 8)) != 0 {
        votes += 1;
        dao_data[16 + (voter_account.key.to_bytes()[0] as usize) / 8] |= 1 << (voter_account.key.to_bytes()[0] as usize % 8);
    }

    // Update votes
    dao_data[0..8].copy_from_slice(&votes.to_le_bytes());

    // Check if voting period has ended
    let current_time = solana_program::clock::Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp;
    let voting_end_time = i64::from_le_bytes(dao_data[24..32].try_into().unwrap());

    if current_time > voting_end_time {
        if votes > total_voters / 2 {
            // Proposal passed
            dao_data[32] = 1; // Set result to passed
        } else {
            // Proposal failed
            dao_data[32] = 0; // Set result to failed
        }
    }

    Ok(())
}
end contract

Would you like to proceed with the deployment of this contract?
